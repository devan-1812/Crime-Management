It contains data ranging from details of criminals to the crime they are involved in . A separate class for officers which contains their ranks and the roles officers 
are assigned . A case can be registered through the system and FIR of that case can be added . Each case or FIR will have Evidence related to it .

 3) Checks Primary Key Constraint in Database .
 4) CSV File Storage can also be used instead of MYSQL . 
 5) Different Classes for Various Departments . 
 6) A Separate Login Page .

  Clone the repository and navigate to the following path
 
 **\CMS\x64\Release\CMS.exe**

 If you have any familiarity with Visual Studio you can build the application yourself using the CMS.sln file .
 
## Development 
  CMS was built on Visual Studio 2022 and written in C++ , the interface was made with Windows Forms . The database of choice was MYSQL Server 8.0 .
  If a user does not have MYSQL installed , CSV file storage can also be used . 
  
**Language** = C++ 

**UI** = Windows Forms 

**Database** = MYSQL 
  
## Limitations
   -> Primary Key Constraint is not available with CSV File Storage
